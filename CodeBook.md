Activity Labels
WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test





TRANSFORMATIONS:

The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings mean and std) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see Identifiers section).

The initial f and t were expanded to frequency domain signals and time respectively.
Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude respectively.
